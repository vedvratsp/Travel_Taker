        <item>I have found out that there ain’t no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them. — Mark Twain </item>

        <item> It is through the voice of one crying in the wilderness that the ways of the gods must be prepared. – Oscar Wilde </item>

        <item>“It seemed an advantage to be traveling alone. Our responses to the world are crucially moulded by the company we keep, for we temper our curiosity to fit in with the expectations of others…Being closely observed by a companion can also inhibit our observation of others; then, too, we may become caught up in adjusting ourselves to the companion’s questions and remarks, or feel the need to make ourselves seem more normal than is good for our curiosity.  – Alain de Botton </item>

        <item>The man who goes alone can start today, but he who travels with another must wait till that other is ready. — Henry David Thoreau </item>

        <item>Travel only with thy equals or thy betters; if there are none, travel alone. — The Dhammapada </item>

        <item>I think one travels more usefully when they travel alone, because they reflect more. — Thomas Jefferson </item>

        <item>Don’t be scared to walk alone. Don’t be scared to like it. — John Mayer </item>

        <item>Through travel I first became aware of the outside world; it was through travel that I found my own introspective way into becoming a part of it. – Eudora Welty </item>

        <item>To awaken quite alone in a strange town is one of the most pleasant sensations in the world. You are surrounded by adventure. </item>

        <item>I learned my strengths and my weaknesses. I experienced the exhilaration of the ups and the despairs of the lows and most of the feelings in between… I learned courage and I learned it myself – Ann Stirk </item>

        <item>The most important relationship in your life is the relationship you have with yourself. Because no matter what happens, you will always be with yourself. </item>

        <item>It’s a long ride home with nothing but me for company. I bore myself sometimes. Not often. Just now and again. ― David Hewson </item>
